# hello-world
Hello there!

I am Maria. Full time workaholic running down the roard to C++ heaven and getting ready to tackle Java soon enough.

I absolutely love to travel outdoors, loosing track of time while reading and dreaming about the day I will set foot in Japan together with the love of my life :)
